# 🍾 Bubblewrap

An unfortunate OpenCV exploration.

# 🚀 Getting up and running

#### Prerequisites

These instructions assume macOS, with XCode and homebrew already installed.

  * ffmpeg
    * `brew install ffmpeg`
  * OpenCV
```bash
$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew install --HEAD opencv --with-ffmpeg
$ echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> bubblewrap-env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
```

#### Easy Way:
??????

`pip instal -r requirements.txt` probably.

#### Hard Way:
Prerequisites:
  * Python Stable, aka Python 2.7, aka that's right-- I called Python3 fake.
    * I'm on Python 2.7.13 but that's probably not important.
  * virtualenv
  * Please actually make sure you have the [prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

1. `virtualenv bubblewrap-env`
2. `source bubblewrap-env/bin/activate`
3. Here's where you hope I took good notes.  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python Trial1.py` should do it! 💁✨ (Or, right-click running in PyCharm or whatever you're using)
