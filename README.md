# 🍾 Bubblewrap

An unfortunate OpenCV exploration.

# 🚀 Getting up and running

#### Easy Way:
??????

`pip instal -r requirements.txt` but don't take my word for it.

#### Hard Way:
Prerequisites:
  * Python Stable, aka Python 2.7, aka that's right-- I called Python3 fake.
    * I'm on Python 2.7.13 but that's probably not important.
  * virtualenv

1. `virtualenv bubblewrap-env`
2. `source bubblewrap-env/bin/activate`
3. Here's where you hope I took good notes.  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### License:
* I'm sorry.
* WTFPL
